# Ubuntu development environment

## What is Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian that is known for its ease of use, stability, and community support. It is widely used by developers, system administrators, and power users for a variety of tasks, including web development, server management, and desktop computing.

## How to use Ubuntu?

To use Ubuntu with WSL, open the Windows Terminal and select the Ubuntu profile. This will launch the Ubuntu shell where you can run Linux commands and utilities.

You can install additional software packages using the `apt` package manager, configure system settings using the `nano` text editor, and manage files and directories using the `ls`, `cd`, and `mkdir` commands.

## How to customize Ubuntu for development?

To customize Ubuntu for development, you can install development tools and libraries using the `apt` package manager. You can also configure the Ubuntu shell by editing the `.bashrc` file, which allows you to set environment variables, aliases, and custom commands.

You can install popular development tools such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Java using the `apt` package manager. You can also install code editors such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom to write and edit code.

### Streamlined installation of development tools

To streamline the installation of development tools, you can create a shell script that installs all the necessary packages and tools with a single command. This allows you to quickly set up your development environment on a new system or virtual machine.

A better approach is to use a configuration management tool such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate the installation and configuration of development tools across multiple systems.

In the following example, we will use Ansible to install development tools on an Ubuntu system:

Check out the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/) for more information on how to use Ansible to automate system administration tasks.

### Ansible post-installation playbook

I have prepared an Ansible playbook that automates the installation of development tools on an Ubuntu system. You can use this playbook to quickly set up your development environment with all the necessary tools and packages.

The playbook is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/TerrorSquad/ansible-post-installation](https://github.com/TerrorSquad/ansible-post-installation)

It will install many popular development tools and packages, including:

- Zsh shell with Oh My Zsh
- Git version control system
- Volta package manager for Node.js
- Docker container platform
- DDEV local development environment
- Visual Studio Code editor
- and many more...

Refer to the playbook documentation for a complete list of tools and packages that will be installed.

## Conclusion

Setting up an Ubuntu development environment with WSL on Windows 11 is a powerful way to leverage the best of both worlds: the flexibility and customization of Linux with the familiarity and compatibility of Windows. By using Ubuntu with WSL, you can build, test, and deploy software applications on a Linux environment without the need for a separate Linux machine.
