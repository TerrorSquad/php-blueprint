# Docker

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It provides a way to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that can run on any system with Docker installed.

## Why use Docker?

- **Portability**: Docker containers are portable and can run on any system with Docker installed, making it easy to deploy applications across different environments.
- **Isolation**: Docker containers provide isolation for applications and their dependencies, ensuring that they run consistently across different systems.
- **Efficiency**: Docker containers are lightweight and share the host system's resources, allowing multiple containers to run on the same system without conflicts.
